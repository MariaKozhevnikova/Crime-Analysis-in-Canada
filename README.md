According to a study performed by Business Insider, Canada has been rated at # 6 as the safest country in the world in 2018. 
This makes Canada one of the most preferred country in the world for immigrants to come in and settle. 
I decided to take a deeper dive into this subject and further analyze the crime data within Canada to study how crime is 
placed across different provinces within Canada, what the general trend is in the last few years 
(is it on the rise or decreasing) and which province is the safest to live in. 
I have made an attempt to study the impact of the provincial spending in the education sector by the government of Canada 
on crime rate and have considered estimated population per province as a factor in my study. 
This report outlines all the steps I have gone through to conduct this comprehensive analysis and presented our findings.
